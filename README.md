## Code for GANs

* General Code for GAN
    * Playground Style Code
        * Module holds Neural Network Structures
        * Env holds data
        * Agent holds Loss function and training
        * Loader manages above processes
        * runs run network
        * main runs program

    * Implementation
        * Module:Linear GAN, DCGAN
        * Env: MNIST, Fashion MNIST
        * Agent: Wgan-GP
    
    * To Run
        * run 'python3 main.py'
        * all arguments are managed by 'config.json'
    
    * TODO
        * Implement 'setup.py'
        * Implement further other agents and envs
